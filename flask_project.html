            This webpage is currently in development. However I thought to share this as my portfolio.
            In this webapp, I used the Flask framework as the backend processing, and in the frontend, there
            are the usual, HTML, CSS and Javasript.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of the application is to replace the master part list which was used as the database for 
            BOM creation. If you aren't familiar with the BOM creation, maybe you may look at the BOM creation
            project that I did as a desktop application. (Click <a href="bom_creation.html">Here</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
            First function that I made was the master part list page, to let users to search parts from more than 25,000
            rows of records. Since I took over the Excel file, I need another page to create part, mass create part and 
            update part. In the search page, the data was passed from Flask file as AJAX source to be inserted into the DataTable.
            It helped with search box, filter function and pagination. For the creation and update of part, user must logged in, so
            that the record shows who did any changes into the master list. So a login decorator is wrapped around those page in Flask App.
            During creating single item or mass create, username will be inserted depending on the login user. Date will be recorded too.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the BOM creation app, users supposed to refer the master part list excel file to generate a BOM list. But since the excel file
            has been replaced by this webapp, the function to create BOM also need to transfer to this app. As of 25th Sept 2022, the BOM creation
            is not fully completed yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides that, I also imported the PDF merger app into this webapp, so that users do not need to install
            anything in their desktop or having any system restrictions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This webapp is currently hosting in one of the spared laptop in the office on local network. So all users on the same network
            will be able to use this app. I am using the waitress to serve the website.
