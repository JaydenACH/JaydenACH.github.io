            This webpage is currently in development. However I thought to share this as my portfolio.
            In this webapp, I used the Flask framework as the backend processing, and in the frontend, there
            are the usual, HTML, CSS and Javasript.

            The purpose of the application is to replace the master part list which was used as the database for 
            BOM creation. If you aren't familiar with the BOM creation, maybe you may look at the BOM creation
            project that I did as a desktop application. (Click <a href="bom_creation.html">Here</a>)
