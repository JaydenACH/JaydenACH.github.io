            Please don't leave just yet, because I know that there are tons
            of PDF merging software and websites out there. So why did I consider this
            project into my portfolio. Hear me out first, it was a chance to
            try out my skills to create an application to solve this little problem. Using
            tkinter, specially <a href="https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter.git">Customtkinter</a>
            from Tom Schimansky and PyPDF2, I wanted to
            customize my very own PDF merger application and share it to others in my office.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the date of the code pushed into GitHub, that was the first version of my
            simple application. I will talk about more on scaling it in near future later.
            # TODO: [insert photo of first look]
        </p>
        <p>
            This application is aimed to solve a problem which is to merge multiple single-page
            PDFs into 1 multipage PDF in order to be printed with double-sided. I didn't want to
            use online websites solution because the documents are confidential. And the existing
            apps are maybe malicious during downloading or putting a watermark in it after merging.
            Making my own application can allow me to design it to my own taste and fit my requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Version 1 of the application is having 2 textboxes to get input from users. First input
            is the path of the folder which contents all and only the PDFs that user wants to merge.
            Second input is to get the name of the new PDF file that is merged. The function mergepdf()
            will walk through the folder and look for all files that ends with .pdf extension. These
            file will be temporarily appended into a list and pass on to the PdfFileReader object by
            PyPDF2. Then the new object will append into the new file name .pdf and save it in the same
            folder. There is a try & exception where if user does not provide a path, the function does
            not work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initial impressions by potential users are that the step to create a directory just to make
            a merged PDF is too tidious. Hence, the code was rewrite into the second version. In version
            2, user can load the PDF through a browsing window from different directories. There will be
            a display of the PDFs that been loaded. Once they are done loading, they can click save as button
            to select the location of where they want to save the new file and provide a new file name just
            like saving any documents from window.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, this version is sufficient to tackle my initial problem statement. So I have leaved it
            as it is and package it to others. Using auto_py_to_exe, I compiled the neccesary dependencies
            into a ZIP file for deployment. However, I am not particularly satisfied with the whole interface
            and user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hence, I have several thoughts in mind to further improve it once I have some time. First improvement
            will be: add a couple more functionalilty into the application. One of them is to manipulate with the
            PDFs that been loaded using method 2. Refering to CRUD, the application can create new pdf files into
            memory, read them to merge into a file, so next will be deleting the loaded pdf if accidentally loaded
            the wrong ones. And finally, update will be refering to the page sequence of the loaded PDFs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another improvement is, since more functionality has been added, the graphical interface should be
            updated accordingly. I wanted a column of tabs on the left side of the application window to display
            the related interface for user depending on the method been selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            The improvement has not been done as of 13th Aug 2022.
